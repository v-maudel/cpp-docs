# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4913
**user defined binary operator ',' exists but no overload could convert all operands, default built-in binary operator ',' used**  
  
 A call to the built-in comma operator occurred in a program that also had an overloaded comma operator; a conversion that you thought may have occurred did not.  
  
 The following code sample generates C4913:  
  
```  
// C4913.cpp  
// compile with: /W4  
struct A  
{  
};  
  
struct S  
{  
};  
  
struct B  
{  
   // B() { }  
   // B(S &s) { s; }  
};  
  
B operator , (A a, B b)     
{  
   a;  
   return b;  
}  
  
int main()  
{  
   A a;  
   B b;  
   S s;  
  
   a, b;   // OK calls user defined operator  
   a, s;   // C4913 uses builtin comma operator  
           // uncomment the conversion code in B to resolve.  
}  
```
